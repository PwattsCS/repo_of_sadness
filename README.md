# Repository of Sadness

# Disclaimer!!!

Please do not run these files on any system that is not being used as part of an NGAV (Next Generation Anti Virus) EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) XDR (Extended Detection and Response). This is purely for demonstrational and educational purposes.

This repo is build to house testing samples that can be used for assessing EDR/XDR tools effectiveness.

It is devided up into the following catergories:

### Ransomware

What is Ransomware:
"Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files. The attackers then demand a ransom from the victim to restore access to the files, often threatening to publish or delete the victim's data if the ransom is not paid. It is a form of cyber attack that can be devastating for individuals and organizations, as it can prevent them from accessing important files and data."

### Delivery

What is Delivery Malware?
"Delivery malware refers to any type of malware that is used to deliver other types of malware to a victim's computer. This can include viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software. Delivery malware is often spread through email attachments, infected websites, or other methods of online communication. Once it is delivered to a victim's computer, it can be used to install other malware or to steal sensitive information from the victim's computer. Delivery malware is a serious threat to individuals and organizations, as it can be used to compromise the security of their systems and steal important data."

### C&C/C2

What is a C&C/C2 Agent?

"Command and control (C&C) agents, also known as "bots" or "zombies," are pieces of software that are installed on a victim's computer without their knowledge. These agents are typically installed as part of a larger malware attack, and they allow the attacker to remotely control the victim's computer. They can be used to steal sensitive information, install additional malware, or carry out other malicious activities on the victim's machine. C&C agents are a major threat to individuals and organizations, as they can be used to compromise the security of their systems and steal important data."

## Why?
Why do we use these seperate catergories?

This is because as part of a malicious attack typically we see atleast one of these phases be used by an attacker, by being able to test these three areas you will be able to effectively assess Malware Based Prevention.
